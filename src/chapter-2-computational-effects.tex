\chapter{Computational effects}
~\label{cpt-effects}

  % Some fairly general words on why computational effects are useful: pure and impure programs, resource-sensitivity... Separate effects, combining several effects into one, modularity issues.

  Recent advances in theory of programming languages led to development and spreading
  of functional programming languages with advanced type systems.
