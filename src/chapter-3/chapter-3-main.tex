\chapter{Building parser combinators as effectful programmes}
\label{cpt-parsers}

A parser is a necessary part of a broad range of software systems: from web browsers
to compilers. Parsers may be automatically generated or hand-written. Like any
software, parsers can carry implementation errors. One of the possible
methods of development of robust and correct-by-design software is using a programming
language with a rich type system. Modern programming languages offer facilities of
lightweight program verification using strict static typing discipline.

Parsing could be thought as a computation that operates over an input sequence of
characters, carrying some state (i.e. current position in input) and have a
possibility to fail. These features are computational effects. Chapter~\ref{cpt-effects}
introduced the most popular approaches to the construction of effectful computations and
this one show how these methods could be used to build parser combinators.

One of the approaches to parser construction that benefits from eloquent type system
is monadic parser combinators~\cite{monParsing}. Is has been widely accepted by the
community and was used to implement industrial-grade \texttt{Haskell} libraries, such
as \texttt{Parsec}~\cite{parsec} and \texttt{Attoparsec}~\cite{attoparsec}. This
approach represents parser as a monad and produces parsers powerful enough to admit
context-sensitive grammars. Section~\ref{cpt-parsers:monadic} gives an account to this kind of parsers.

A parser could be represented not only by monadic computation but also by an
applicative functor~\cite{Mcbride:2008:APE:1348940.1348941}. An applicative interface
is less restrictive than monadic one, but even though, it is possible to capture
context-free grammars. These parsers are described in
section~\ref{cpt-parsers:applicative}.

It is also feasible to represent an interface of a parser as an algebraic effect and
the process of analysis as a handler for this effect. Unlike monads and applicative functors,
algebraic effects do not still have wide support in popular programming languages.
Section~\ref{cpt-parsers:alg-eff} shows how parsing could be expressed using this
approach and provides examples in an experimental programming language~\texttt{Frank}
that has built-in support for algebraic effects and handlers.

  \section{Monadic parsers}
  \label{cpt-parsers:monadic}

    \subsection{Monads in Haskell}
      Monads were firstly injected into programming languages context as a tool to
      assign a denotational semantics to computational effects~\cite{Moggi:1991:NCM:116981.116984}. Later, the have been adopted as a programming
      paradigm and introduced into functional programming languages~\cite{Wadler:1992:EFP:143165.143169}. Monads are sometimes refereed as a ``programmable semicolon'' --- a powerful way to construct sequences of computation with possible side-effect. Afterwards, even more notions from category theory were given first-class support in modern programming languages, providing programmers with highly abstract, powerfully expressive and mathematically structured ways to build software.

      In \texttt{Haskell} programming language, monads are types that have an instance of \texttt{Monad} type class and satisfy three laws. They are used
      to distinguish pure computations from ones having some kind of side effect:
      mutable state, exceptions, non-determinism, etc.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
class Monad m where
  (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b)   -> m b
  (>>)   :: m a ->  m b         -> m b
  return ::   a                 -> m a
  fail   :: String -> m a
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{\texttt{Monad} type class}
      \label{listing:monadClass}
      \end{figure}

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
return a >>= k                  =  k a
m        >>= return             =  m
m        >>= (\x -> k x >>= h)  =  (m >>= k) >>= h
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Monad laws}
      \label{listing:monadLaws}
      \end{figure}

      The \lstinline{>>=} operation, also known as \emph{monadic bind}, represents
      a, mentioned earlier, ``programmable semicolon''. It takes a value in a monadic context as it first argument, an action that transforms that value as a second argument and returns a transformed value in the same monadic context.

      Monads have broad usage in functional programming. They are first-class citizens
      in purely-functional languages like~\texttt{Haskell} and a wide range of~\texttt{Haskell}-libraries have monadic interface. Mainstream programming languages also
      employ specific monads in a form of build-in language constructions,
      i.e.~\texttt{LINQ} in~\texttt{C\#} or optionals in~\texttt{Swift}.

      As it was previously said, monads are used to characterise types of computations with a particular side effect. But what if a computation may
      potentially produce two or more effects? Then, means to combine several
      computational effects are needed. Monadic approach provide notion of
      ~\emph{monad transformer}~\cite{Liang:1995:MTM:199448.199528} --- a type that
      may add properties of a given monad to any other. Monad transformers are widely
      used in~\texttt{Haskell} to build computations carrying multiple side effects.


    \subsection{Parser as a Monad}

      Consider a simple type to represent a parser.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
type Parser a = String -> Maybe (a,String)
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Basic parser type}
      \label{listing:maybeParser}
      \end{figure}

      In this representation, parser is a
      function, taking input stream and returning a list of possible valid
      variants of analysis in conjunction with corresponding input stream
      remains. Empty list of result stands for completely unsuccessful attempt of
      parsing, whereas multiple results mean ambiguity.

      Types similar to \texttt{Parser a} may be treated as effectful computation.
      To represent computations with effects a concept of
      \texttt{Monad} is used in~\texttt{Haskell} programming language. This particular
      type could be made an instance of \texttt{Monad} type class.
      Comprehensive information about properties of parsers like one presented
      above may be found in paper~\cite{monParsing}.

      To extend capabilities and improve convenience of syntactic analysers, set of
      effects of parser could be expanded: it is handy to run parsers in a configurable
      environment or introduce logging. In this section two approaches to combination
      of computational effects will be considered: monad transformers and extensible
      effects.

    \subsection{Factorising parser into monad transformers stack}

  \section{Applicative parsing}
  \label{cpt-parsers:applicative}

  \section{Parsers as algebraic effects}
  \label{cpt-parsers:alg-eff}

  Algebraic effects and effects handlers provide an alternative to monads and monad
  transformers way to express effectful computations. Building parser combinators in
  term of algebraic effects and the process of parsing as their handlers is a solid
  model problem to find out strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

  This section describes leads to prototype implementations of parser
  combinators libraries in experimental programming language
  Frank~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/LindleyMM17} which has first-class support for
  algebraic effects and effects handlers. Parsers may be represented either by
  combination of multiple effects, for instance, mutable state and possible failure,
  or may be expressed as a monolith effect signature. In conclusion, a
  note on expressive power of Franks implementation of algebraic effects and
  handlers is made.

  \subsection{As a combination of effects}

    Section~\ref{cpt-effects:alg-effects} gives an account on algebraic effects and
    effects handlers and, in particular, on programming with these concepts in Frank
    programming language. This section employs Frank to build a prototype of parser
    combinators library.

    \subsubsection{Defining parser combinators}

    As is has been already said, simple parser could be expressed as a computation
    with two effects: state of input stream and a possibility of failure. Thus,
    handling parsing means handling a combination of those two effects, that is done
    by composing handlers for failure and state (see
    listing~\ref{listing:parserHandlerCombo}).

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
parse : {[Error, State (List Char)] X} -> (List Char) -> Maybe X
parse p str = catch (state str p!)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Handling combination of state and failure}
    \label{listing:parserHandlerCombo}
    \end{figure}

    First parser that serves as a most basic building block in construction of
    more advanced ones is the~\emph{unconditional consumer}.
    It must take the first item
    of the input stream and yield it as a result, updating the state of the input
    stream with it's remains. In case of exhausted input, parser must fail. That
    is exactly the behaviour described by~\lstinline{item} function of listing
    ~\ref{listing:parserItemCombo}.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
item : [Error, State (List Char)] Char
item! = on get! { nil -> fail
                | (x :: xs) -> put xs; x}
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Parser consuming single item}
    \label{listing:parserItemCombo}
    \end{figure}

    Of course, unconditional consumption of the input stream without any actions
    doesn't make much sense. Actually, we would prefer consuming some items to others. Thus,~\emph{conditional consumer} that checks if an item satisfies a
    given predicate prior to consuming and fails otherwise, must be
    implemented (~\ref{listing:parserSatCombo}).

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
sat : {Char -> [Error, State (List Char)] Bool} ->
      [Error, State (List Char)] Char
sat p = on item! {c -> if (p c) {c} {fail}}
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Conditional consumer}
    \label{listing:parserSatCombo}
    \end{figure}

    Having these basic building blocks, we are already able to construct
    practical parsers. A useful application of~\texttt{sat} is
    the~\texttt{char} parser that accepts a given character from the input
    stream (listing~\ref{parserCharCombo}).

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
char : Char -> [Error, State (List Char)] Char
char c = sat {x -> eqChar x c}
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Parser for a given character}
    \label{listing:parserCharCombo}
    \end{figure}

    Besides accepting specific characters,~\texttt{sat} parser could be used
    to implement other basic parsers. For instance, if predicate
    ~\texttt{isLetter} determining weather of not given character is Latin letter is defined, we could supply it to~\texttt{sat} and acquire a parser for letters (listing~\ref{listing:parserLetterCombo}). The same could be done for decimal
    (or other) digits.

    \begin{figure}[h]`
    \begin{lstlisting}
letter : [Error, State (List Char)]Char
letter! = sat isLetter

digit : [Error, State (List Char)]Char
digit! = sat isDigit
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Parsers letters and digits}
    \label{listing:parserLetterCombo}
    \end{figure}

    Now, being able to parse singular characters, we can make ourselves a task
    to accept sequences. That could be useful, for example, to parse terminals of
    some grammar. Here the main power of Frank's effect support comes in handy.
    As far as a string is essentially a list of characters, we can use the
    standard~\texttt{map} function in presence of~\texttt{Error}
    and~\texttt{State (List Char)}~\emph{abilities}.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
string : (List Char) ->
         [Error, State (List Char)] (List Char)
string str = map char str
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Parser for a given string}
    \label{listing:parserStrCombo}
    \end{figure}

    But individual chars and known-in-advance strings are not that interesting. Therefore, turn comes to actually building actual combinators: alternative
    and repetition.

    Consider the case we have to parsers $p_1$ and $p_2$, and we would like to
    construct a parser that accepts all inputs that are recognisable by both
    $p_1$ and $p_2$. In our setting we could implement this by deterministic
    choice: we apply $p_1$ and yield the result if it succeeds, otherwise we
    apply $p_2$ and initialise an error if it has failed, returning its
    result in case of success.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
choose : {[Error, State (List Char)] X} ->
         {[Error, State (List Char)] X} ->
          [Error, State (List Char)] X
choose p1 p2 =
  on (parse p1 get!) { (right _)  -> p1!
                     | (left  _)  ->  on (parse p2 get!)
                       { (right _)   -> p2!
                       | (left err)  -> throw err
                       }
                     }
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Alternative combinator}
    \label{listing:parserChooseCombo}
    \end{figure}

    For the simplest instance for~\texttt{choose} usage, reconsider
    ~\texttt{letter} and~\texttt{digit} parsers. We could combine those with the
    alternative combinator to accept alphanumeric characters
    (listing~\ref{listing:parserAlphanumCombo}).

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
alphanum : [Error, State (List Char)]Char
alphanum! = choose digit letter
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Parser for alphanumerics}
    \label{listing:parserAlphanumCombo}
    \end{figure}

    The motivation for repetition combinators is the need to apply an already defined
    parser multiple times with no certainty about the amount of required applications.
    Repetition combinators are useful for problems like parsing a sequence
    of statements of a programming language. In parser combinators approach,
    repetition combinators are usually defined as two mutually recursive functions:
    ~\texttt{many} accepts the result of zero or more applications of its
    argument-parser $p$ and~\texttt{some} succeeds if $p$ is applicable at least
    once.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
many : {[Error, State (List Char)]X} ->
        [Error, State (List Char)](List X)
many p = choose {some p} {nil}

some : {[Error, State (List Char)] X} ->
        [Error, State (List Char)](List X)
some p = p! :: many p
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Repetition combinators}
    \label{listing:parserManyCombo}
    \end{figure}

    As an example of repetition combinator usage, consider parser for words ---
    a sequence of letters (listing~\ref{listing:parserWordCombo}).

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
word : [Error, State (List Char)] (List Char)
word! = some letter
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Parser for words}
    \label{listing:parserWordCombo}
    \end{figure}

    Besides plain sequences, it is very common to have sequences separated by some
    kind of marker, for instance in CSV files. Therefore, a repetition with separation
    combinator could be useful. It could be implemented on top of~\texttt{many}
    combinator, see listing~\ref{listing:parserSepbyCombo}. Again,~\texttt{sepby}
    accepts any, including empty, sequence, while~\texttt{sepby1} requires at least
    one complete period.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
sepby : {[Exception ParseError, State String]X} ->
        {[Exception ParseError, State String]Y} ->
        [Exception ParseError, State String](List X)
sepby p sep = choose {sepby1 p sep} {[]}

sepby1 : {[Exception ParseError, State String]X} ->
         {[Exception ParseError, State String]Y} ->
         [Exception ParseError, State String](List X)
sepby1 p sep = p! :: (many {sep!; p!})
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Repetition with separation combinators}
    \label{listing:parserSepbyCombo}
    \end{figure}

    The discussed combinators

    \subsubsection{Case-study: parsing simplified Markdown}

    As a usage example for the developed library, consider the
    parser of simplified Markdown-like language. We take into account only basic
    constructions to keep the example concise: the language is limited to headers,
    plain paragraphs of text and unordered lists. The abstract syntax tree of
    the language is captured in Frank by the algebraic data type
    (listing~\ref{listing:parserMdAstCombo}).

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
data Document = Document (List Block)

data Block = Blank
           | Header (Pair Int Line)
           | Paragraph (List Line)
           | UnorderedList (List Line)

data Line = Empty | NonEmpty (List String)
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Simplified Markdown AST}
      \label{listing:parserMdAstCombo}
      \end{figure}

      Again, to keep this example simple and concise, we do not consider any in-line
      formatting like bold or italic cases. Therefore in-line elements are represented
      as plain strings of characters. The line of text is either an empty line or
      non-empty one, and we use~\texttt{choose} combinator to represent this
      alternative (listing~\ref{listing:parserLineCombo}). An empty line is a sequence of
      spaces terminated with a newline character --- exactly this is captured by
      ~\texttt{emptyLine} parser: we use~\texttt{many} combinator supplying parser
      for a whitespace, then the parser for a newline character and, finally, the
      data constructor~\texttt{Empty} of~\texttt{Line} data type. To build a parser for
      a non-empty line, we need to refine the previous parser to be able to accept the
      meaningful contents. We use repetition with separation combinator~\texttt{sepby}
      to parse a sequence of words separated by spaces and then return an accepted sequence
      wrapped up in the~\texttt{NonEmpty} data constructor. The interesting
      thing here is the~\texttt{let}-binding. We need to accept and than throw away
      the newline character that terminates the line, but at the same time we need to save
      the meaningful contents. Hence we parse it and bind to a name for later use in
      data constructor that gets returned. In Frank we work with
      effectful functions in the same way like we do with the pure ones; therefore
      syntactic sugar similar to~\texttt{do}-notation becomes redundant.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
line : [Exception ParseError, State String] Line
line! = choose emptyLine nonEmptyLine

emptyLine : [Exception ParseError, State String] Line
emptyLine! = many {char ' '};
             char '\n';
             Empty

nonEmptyLine : [Exception ParseError, State String] Line
nonEmptyLine! = many {char ' '};
                let ws = sepby word {char ' '}
                in char '\n'; NonEmpty ws
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Parsers for lines}
      \label{listing:parserLineCombo}
      \end{figure}

      The abstract syntax described in listing~\ref{listing:parserMdAstCombo}
      has a data type to represent a block of a Markdown document. To be able to
      implement a parser for blocks we must implement a parser for every possible
      block type: header, paragraph or unordered list.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
block : [Exception ParseError, State String] Block
block! = choose header {choose paragraph unorderedList}
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Parser for a block of Markdown document}
      \label{listing:parserExprAppCombo}
      \end{figure}

      A Markdown header is a sequence of hash (\#) symbols followed by a
      non-empty line of text. The number of hashes represents the level of
      importance of the header, that is, one hash stands for HTML
      tag~\texttt{<h1>}, two hashes for ~\texttt{<h2>}, etc. Therefore, the parser
      needs to count the hashes and supply the number as an argument to the~\texttt{Header}
      data constructor. Exactly that is done by~\texttt{header} parser and, thanks to Franks
      applicative syntax for effects, we could supply the calls to inner parsers directly
      as the arguments to the resulting data constructor.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
header : [Exception ParseError, State String] Block
header! = Header (length (some {char '#'})) line!
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Direct applicative style of defining parsers}
      \label{listing:parserExprAppCombo}
      \end{figure}

      Parsers for paragraphs and unordered lists are similar. We use repetition
      combinator~\texttt{some} to accept a non-empty sequence of lines for a paragraph and
      a non-empty sequence of lines prefixed with a star for unordered list.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
paragraph : [Exception ParseError, State String] Block
paragraph! = Paragraph (some nonEmptyLine)

unorderedList : [Exception ParseError, State String] Block
unorderedList! = UnorderedList (some (char '*'; line))
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Direct applicative style of defining parsers}
      \label{listing:parserExprAppCombo}
      \end{figure}

      Finally, we are ready to implement a parser for the complete document as a
      non-empty sequence of blocks.

      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
document : [Exception ParseError, State String] Document
document! = Document (some block)
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Parser for the document}
      \label{listing:parserMdDocCombo}
      \end{figure}

      To parse the document, we use the~\texttt{parse} function that was defined earlier
      in this section, supplying the parser and the input string. If everything is
      correct, the resulting AST will be produced.


      \begin{figure}[h]
      \begin{lstlisting}
> parse document "# ToDo list\nThings to do today\n* Drink coffee\n* Write thesis\n"

right (Document ([Header 1 (NonEmpty (["ToDo", "list"])),
                  Paragraph ([NonEmpty (["Things", "to", "do", "today"])]),
                  UnorderedList ([NonEmpty (["Drink", "coffee"]),
                                 NonEmpty (["Write", "thesis"])])]))
      \end{lstlisting}
      \caption{Using the parser}
      \label{listing:parserExprMainCombo}
      \end{figure}

      The implemented parser is a simple example of usage of parser combinators library
      implemented on top of algebraic effects and handlers abstraction. It gives a
      good example of usage of the facilities that Frank provides to build
      effectful computations.

  \subsection{As a standalone effect}

    The minimal parser combinators interface could be described with a monolithic
    algebraic effect. It could bring parsers a usual a benefit of algebraic effects
    and effects handlers approach: independence of effect's commands and their interpretation.
    This was proved to be useful by Lindley~\cite{Lindley:2014:AEE:2633628.2633636}
    for parsers: a single set of parsing commands could be given different interpretations
    with idioms, arrows and monads, yielding parsers of different expressiveness.

    As far as Frank has built-in support for algebraic effects and effects handlers,
    implementation of a monolithic effect for parsing could be a natural way to
    represent parsers in Frank.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
interface Parser =
    fail : forall Y . Y
  | sat : {Char -> Bool} -> Char
  | choose : forall Y . {[Parser] Y} -> {[Parser] Y} -> Y
  | many : forall Y . {[Parser] Y} -> List Y
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Monolithic parsing effect}
    \label{listing:parserEffMono}
    \end{figure}

    However, we came into a restriction of Frank's
    effects system, which makes it impossible to express the parser's signature
    as desired due to impossibility to construct effect interfaces incorporation
    generalised algebraic data types. That is, every command of the interface must
    return a value of the same (maybe polymorphic) type, making an interface from
    listing~\ref{listing:parserEffMono} impossible to express.

   \subsection{Discussion}

    Frank provides convenient and expressive features for programming with
    algebraic effects and handlers. Frank's native support for computations with
    multiple effects doesn't require programmes to deal with much of boilerplate.
    When the collection of effects of the computation is determined, there is nothing
    more holding the programmer from doing his job: no need to wrap one's head around
    complex types like monad transformers stacks and static effects ordering.
    In addition, direct applicative style of defining effectful computations often
    leaves in unnecessary to give names to interim results, thus making code
    easier to follow.

    Representing parser as a computation combining several side effects is a
    triumph of modularity. Nevertheless, it somehow abuses one of the most important
    points about algebraic effects and effect handlers: the independence of
    syntax and semantics. Of course, parsing is perfectly representable by the
    combination of several algebraic effects, but it might also be interesting
    and useful to represent it as a separate effect signature to be able to assign
    different interpretations to the same parser's syntax.

    Unfortunately, the current state of Frank's effect system doesn't provide a way
    to express effect interfaces required for building full-featured parser combinators
    as a monolithic effect. The system could be refined by introducing a possibility
    to incorporate GADTs into effect signatures.

    Because Frank is in its infancy, it lacks some useful language features that
    are habitual from more mature functional languages. For example, there is no
    way to declare type synonyms; hence the
    effect list must be included in type signature of every parser combinator, making
    source code a bit more verbose than in could be.
